                <p>So, you’re a frequent hiker, and you even try to get in a few weekend backpacks every summer. Now you're interested in taking it up a notch. Before you run out and try to join hiking’s varsity squad, you need to be prepared.</p>

            <div class="start-text">
                <div class="row-1">
                    <p>One of the biggest misconceptions about long-distance hikes is that they are just like a regular backpack, only longer. Yes and no.</p>
                    <p class="iphone"><img src="img/00_header/iphone.png" alt="iphone"></p>
                </div>
                <div class="row-2">
                    <p>Unlike a weekender in the Enchantments, a long-distance hike (we’re talking a week to a month or even up to six months if you’re looking at the entire PCT) is an exercise in endurance and perseverance, both mentally and physically.</p>
                    <p>But it’s not all about pain and suffering. A long-distance hike offers an exciting opportunity to get away from it all and experience wilderness in a way that shorter trips often don’t allow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="row-3">
                    <p>If you’re out for just a few days, you often have to turn around and head home just as you’re getting your trail groove on. But a long trip puts you out in big, wide-open nature where your everyday life fades into the background and your only cares become the next mountain view, the next cool water source and the next choice campsite.</p>
                    <p>But in order to pull off a successful long-distance or thru-hike, you need to plan and prepare with a goal in mind but be able to take any curveballs that come your way.</p>
